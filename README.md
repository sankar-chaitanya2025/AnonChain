## 📌 Progress Log  

📅 **Feb 05** → Completed **8 lessons** in blockchain basics from Cyfrin. 🎯 Target: Finish the remaining lessons tomorrow and wrap up blockchain basics!  
📅 **Feb 06** → Had a meeting with DSW on **boycott FC**, didn't get much done. 😞 Will complete blockchain basics tomorrow. Hope **Tanu** stays safe and focuses on her studies. 🙏  
📅 **Feb 07** → Learning about **Proof of Work (PoW) & Proof of Stake (PoS)**. See explanation below. 🔥

# 🔍 Understanding Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

Let's imagine a **pizza restaurant** where customers place orders (transactions) and the restaurant staff processes these orders (validates transactions). 🍕

## 🍕 Scenario 1: Proof of Work (PoW) - The Old System

### **How It Works:**
- Many chefs (**miners**) compete to prepare each pizza (**block**).
- To bake a pizza, they must **solve a puzzle** (do hard work, like kneading tough dough).
- The first chef to finish gets to bake the pizza and **earns a reward + customer tips (gas fees)**.
- Other chefs wasted time and energy competing but got **nothing**. 😞

### **Problems in PoW:**
❌ **Wastes energy** – Many chefs work on the same pizza, but only one gets paid.  
❌ **Slow service** – Only a few pizzas can be made per hour.  
❌ **Expensive** – Chefs need special ovens (**high-end mining computers**).  

---

## 🍕 Scenario 2: Proof of Stake (PoS) - The New System

### **How It Works:**
- Instead of making all chefs compete, the restaurant **chooses one chef at random** to make the pizza.
- To qualify, chefs must **pay a deposit (stake ETH)**.
- A chef is randomly picked to bake the pizza and gets **paid + customer tips (gas fees)**.
- If the chef makes a bad pizza (tries to cheat), the restaurant **takes away their deposit**. ❌

### **Benefits of PoS:**
✅ **No wasted effort** – Only one chef works on each pizza.  
✅ **Faster service** – More pizzas (**transactions**) are made quickly.  
✅ **Lower cost** – No need for expensive ovens (**high-powered mining rigs**).

## ⛽ How Miners/Validators Earn ETH from Gas Fees?

Let’s say customers are ordering pizzas:
- Every order has a **base fee** (burned pizza crust - no one eats it).
- Customers can also leave a **tip** for faster service. 💰

### **In Proof of Work (PoW) - Before Ethereum 2.0:**
- The fastest chef to solve the dough puzzle gets **the tip + pizza price**.
- Other chefs get nothing. ❌

### **In Proof of Stake (PoS) - After Ethereum 2.0:**
- A chef is randomly selected to bake the pizza and gets **the tip + pizza price**.
- Part of the pizza (**base fee**) **is burned** to reduce extra ETH supply. 🔥

## 🥇 Summary of PoW vs. PoS

| Feature            | Proof of Work (PoW) 🍕 | Proof of Stake (PoS) 🍕 |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Who cooks?** | Chefs compete | One chef is randomly chosen |
| **How to qualify?** | Solve a dough puzzle | Pay a deposit (stake ETH) |
| **How is ETH earned?** | Winner gets rewards + tips | Chosen chef gets rewards + tips |
| **Efficiency?** | Wastes energy | Uses only what's needed |
| **Speed?** | Slow | Fast |
| **Cost?** | High (requires special ovens) | Low (anyone with ingredients can join) |

### 🍕 Why Ethereum Switched from PoW to PoS?  
1️⃣ **Less energy waste** – No useless kneading of dough.  
2️⃣ **Faster transactions** – More pizzas can be served.  
3️⃣ **Fairer earnings** – No need for expensive ovens (**mining rigs**).  
4️⃣ **ETH supply control** – Some pizza crust (**base fee**) is burned to prevent inflation. 🔥

## ✨ Final Thoughts  
🚀 My journey so far has been **amazing**! 😍 I'll spend a day editing all README files so I can use this as my **learning journal**. 📖 

💡 **Stay tuned for more updates on AnonChain!** 🔥
