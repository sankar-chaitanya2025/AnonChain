# AnonChain: Decentralized Anonymous Social Network  

🚀 *Project Goal:*  
Build a blockchain-based *anonymous social media platform* where users can post messages without revealing their identity.  

🎯 *Tech Stack:*  
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)  
- Foundry (Testing)  
- IPFS (Decentralized Storage)  
- zk-SNARKs (Anonymous Identity Verification)  
- Hardhat (Development & Deployment)  
- React + Web3.js (Frontend)  

📌 *Current Progress:* 
Feb - 05 -> Today I completed 8 lessons in block chain basics from cyfrin :), Target is to complete remaining all lessons tommorow and wrap up block chain basics !
Feb - 06 -> Gone through a meeting with DSW on boycott fc today, can't get the work done. Will complete BlockChain Basics tommorow. Hope, Tanu will stay safe and complete her studies.

### **Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake - Explained with an Analogy**  

Let’s imagine a **pizza restaurant** where customers place orders (transactions) and the restaurant staff processes these orders (validates transactions).  

---

## **🍕 Scenario 1: Proof of Work (PoW) - The Old System**  

### **How It Works:**  
- There are many chefs (miners) in the kitchen.  
- To prepare each pizza (block), the chefs must **solve a puzzle** (do hard work, like kneading tough dough).  
- The first chef to finish the puzzle gets to bake the pizza and **earn a reward + customer tips (gas fees).**  
- Other chefs wasted time and energy competing but got nothing.  

### **Problems in PoW:**  
❌ **Wastes energy** – Many chefs work on the same pizza, but only one gets paid.  
❌ **Slow service** – Only a few pizzas can be made per hour.  
❌ **Expensive** – Chefs need special ovens (high-end mining computers).  

---

## **🍕 Scenario 2: Proof of Stake (PoS) - The New System**  

### **How It Works:**  
- Instead of making all chefs compete, the restaurant **chooses one chef at random** to make the pizza.  
- But to be eligible, chefs must **pay a deposit (stake ETH).**  
- A chef is randomly picked to bake the pizza and gets **paid + customer tips (gas fees).**  
- If the chef makes a bad pizza (tries to cheat), the restaurant **takes away their deposit.**  

### **Benefits of PoS:**  
✅ **No wasted effort** – Only one chef works on each pizza.  
✅ **Faster service** – More pizzas (transactions) are made quickly.  
✅ **Lower cost** – No need for expensive ovens (high-powered mining rigs).

## **⛽ How Miners/Validators Earn ETH from Gas Fees?**  

Let’s say customers are ordering pizzas:  
- Every order has a **base fee** (burned pizza crust - no one eats it).  
- Customers can also leave a **tip** for faster service.  

### **In Proof of Work (PoW) - Before Ethereum 2.0:**  
- The fastest chef to solve the dough puzzle gets **the tip + pizza price.**  
- Other chefs get nothing.  

### **In Proof of Stake (PoS) - After Ethereum 2.0:**  
- A chef is randomly selected to bake the pizza and gets **the tip + pizza price.**  
- Part of the pizza (base fee) **is burned** to reduce extra supply.

## **🥇 Summary of PoW vs. PoS**  

| Feature            | Proof of Work (PoW) 🍕 | Proof of Stake (PoS) 🍕 |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Who cooks?** | Chefs compete | One chef is randomly chosen |
| **How to qualify?** | Solve a dough puzzle | Pay a deposit (stake ETH) |
| **How is ETH earned?** | Winner gets rewards + tips | Chosen chef gets rewards + tips |
| **Efficiency?** | Wastes energy | Uses only what's needed |
| **Speed?** | Slow | Fast |
| **Cost?** | High (requires special ovens) | Low (anyone with ingredients can join) |

---

### **🍕 Why Ethereum Switched from PoW to PoS?**  
1. **Less energy waste** – No useless kneading of dough.  
2. **Faster transactions** – More pizzas can be served.  
3. **Fairer earnings** – No need for expensive ovens (mining rigs).  
4. **ETH supply control** – Some pizza crust (base fee) is burned to prevent inflation.  
My journey was amazing !!!! :)
